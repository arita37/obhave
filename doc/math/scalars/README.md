This is just an unfinished draft.

The scalars here are related to [the Infromation-Energy Theory](https://medium.com/not-science-just-a-theory/not-science-just-a-theory-information-energy-theory-c21e5a6c874a).

h, the nature of this scalar depends on the nature of the tag universe and concept space. To put it in more programmatic language, the h is a scalar, which measures the potential for a change. In some systems there could be mood tags, which would guide the system to make bold recommendations upon good mood and less risky recommendation upon negative mood. It could also consist of the payment history or time spent within the service by a user.

m, the abstraction of the Social Networks (size and topology) as scale-free macro or micro level network, which is shaped by domain specific rules, which compare the m of the subject to the m of the actor (a recommendation by a friend or the system or a tag or a concept within the system).

d, The Effort of Influence. This is probably related to the learning rate and computational iterations and priorities. The machine learning problem is to reduce d to minimum or maximize the efficiency. For example, the User Interface should consist of different efforts of influence, like content priorities. If Influence Force and the Mood of the user would create a probability combination, which would at the present moment allow risky recommendation with less effort of influence, it should be chosen. When the recommendation environment requires more effort than usually, it should not be selected. This is related to the Nash Equilibrium and auction theories of maximizing benefits.

cos(theta), forms a multidimensional Cost Factor of Influence, which works as Homomorphic Filter matrix between the nature of the F vector and socio-personal needs derived from the Human Kinetic Information-Energy and Human Potential Information-Energy. The math will be multidimensional.

c, The Euclidean Distance of the network, which will create the global connection between all entities within certain levels of abstraction. A probability of recommendation would be 100% within a network of start topology of homogeneous entities.

hv (Planck), The Relationship Between the history data and the most current learning set. This could be the LocalStorage events of a user session compared to the historical behavior of the user.
