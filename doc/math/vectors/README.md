**g**, The Wealth of Networks, which include influences through e.g. reputation-appreciation networks; likes, favorites, shares of the networks. In more genral sense it seems that **g** is related to the business goals of the recommendation engine, which differ from learning goals.

**v**, The Experience of Self, which reflects the behavior of the user and where the user might be heading to. This indicator is also realted to the learning goals and might not be measurable as it's effects might come to existance by simple handicaps / rewards between the competing recommendation stereotypes.

**F**, The Social Influence as a vector, which creates the other half of the recommendation engine auction mechanism. Content want's to be discovered, but should use it's force only when it has high probability of being discovered. In practice certain amount of force is required in order for the reward mechanisms to persist learning; this works like Planck's constant within quantum mechanics.
