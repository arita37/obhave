OBHave! is an OpenSource project for building adding Machine Learning based Content Recommendation Systems to Web-components as a PnP Service

This project has been on a break, since I am unable to find a commercial angle for it, however it is very much realted to my [Immersive Reality Book-project](https://coboat.jovoto.com/ideas/47381) and [Theory of Information Evolution](https://medium.com/not-science-just-a-theory/not-science-just-a-theory-theory-of-information-evolution-cea93e703e4d).

The former idea would require a recommendation engine, which finds relevance between the content authors have written and Call-To-Actions known to the system and arrange them to [a Concept-Space of a Tag Universe](https://medium.com/not-science-just-a-theory/not-science-just-a-theory-concept-space-of-the-tag-universe-da2e5f3bd18f).

The latter idea is a mathematical model, which would enable the building of a recommendation engine based on BASE-architecture instead of ATOM-architecture. The biggest mistake of recommendation engines today are done by creating user specific recommendations (as opposed to group recommendations and stereotype combinations) and not solving the cold start problems properly. The theory of information evolution has a mathematical / physical model of Information-Energy Theory, which is not scientifically proven (yet), but only works as a metaphor for combining existing research to a useful metaphor upon which a more specific mathematical model can be built.
